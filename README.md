# Non-Promise-Version-of-Unique-Sink-Orientations

This program creates a linear program whose optimal value is the expected number of queries of the best randomized algorithm in a non-promise version of sink finding in unique sink orientations. 
The linear program is outputed in a .lp file.

The program only requires the installation of a c++ compiler and standard libraries.

Due to the difficulty of this problem and runtime, this program is only feasible when the dimension of the hypercube $N$ satifies $N \leq 3$.

The code was presented in the article "Non-Promise Version of Unique Sink Orientations" by Tiago Oliveira Marques, and was inpired by the thesis "Randomized Algorithms to Locate the Sink in Low Dimensional Unique Sink Orientations of Cubes" by Stefano Tessaro.
